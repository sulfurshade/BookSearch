This is an Asynchronous Web Apps Capstone Project by Joey Wolter.
My project takes a search term provided by a user, and pushes it to the Google Books API. Google Books returns a list of books comparable to the search term entered. The user can then find a book they are interested in and click on the Find Recommendations button. The selected book title is ran through the TasteDive API which returns similar books, if any are found.
